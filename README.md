# EntitycomponentsystemShapeDraw
A lightweight C++ project that demonstrates how to draw shapes using an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. The goal of this project is to show how rendering logic, data, and behavior can be cleanly separated using ECS principles.

## Features

ECS Architecture

. Entities: abstract game objects

. Components: Shape data (circle, rectangle, etc.), Transform, Color

. Systems: Rendering system, movement/logic system

## Rendering

Renders basic shapes to a window (circle, rectangle, etc.)

## Modular & Extendable

Easy to add new components and systems

Clean separation between data and behavior

Beginner-Friendly Example

Great reference for learning ECS patterns in C++/Qt
